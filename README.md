This is a personal project by me, Filmo is an AI-based search engine that accomodate user that want to find a film based on their criteria. This project is built on Next.Js with Tailwind framework, AI engine by Gemini Flash.
<p><b>last Update:</b>The search engine no longer work due to funding problem that unable to use the API anymore</p>
